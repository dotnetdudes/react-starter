# Styling

THe CSS and Styling is handled though the [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) implementation using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) as the style engine.  

## Theming

The main styling should be implemented using Material UI [themes](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/). Out of the box the starter kit comes with a light and dark theme but this can be easily extended to provide as many themes as required.  

```website/src/app/components/ThemeProvider```
