# Environment setup

If there is a requirement for additional resources such as database server, Authentication servers or apis, these can be configured using the provided Docker Compose file and set up using [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) scripting.

*Both the docker and powershell resources can be removed if there is no requirement for environment setup in your project. The Mongodb instance is there purely as an example.*
