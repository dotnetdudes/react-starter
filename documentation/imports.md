# Imports

The project has been configured to enable ```import``` statements to be aliased using the '@' character as absolute paths under the **src** directory. This avoids the need to use relative imports and the resulting nested import hell.

```
    import SomeContainer from 'app/containers/SomeContainer';   
    import SomeComponent from 'app/components/SomeComponent';   
    import SomeFeature from 'app/features/SomeFeature';  
```
